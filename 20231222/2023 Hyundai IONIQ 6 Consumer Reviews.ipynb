      "['The car has a very comfortable and quiet ride. There are a lot of security features and ways to adjust to your preference. Inside features are very nice and not overstated. The outside is more appealing, at least to me, in comparison to some other EV’s in the same price range. In addition, more car features available on the Limited version than available on other similarly priced EV’s in the current market. Lots of leg room in both the front and back seats. It is low to the ground so feels and handles like a sports car. ', 'Love the car; the sports version is zippy, the economy version gives 310+ miles range with AC on. Fast charging is free for two years\\nThe interiors are awesome with the ambient lighting really giving a cool vibe. \\nThe HDA, lane change and managing the lanes works mostly. This can be slightly better especially when changing lanes quickly\\nI test drove: Model 3, ID.4, Bolt SUV premier, Model Y. Liked this car the best as a combination of build quality + drive quality. Software on Model 3 is better but I liked overall build quality of Ioniq 6 better. ', 'I continually told my wife that we did not need to go electric for a vehicle since we don’t drive that much.  We searched for a new Santa Fe but while at the dealer we saw the Ionic 6.  After learning about the features and cap abilities we decided to move forward.  The biggest lesson I learned is that once again I was wrong and she was right.  Because we don’t drive that far is the exact reason we need this car.  It is so fun to drive and looks awesome as well.  We installed a level 2 charger in the garage, approximately $700 for the 220 power and the charger and it is so convenient to just charge at home at any time.   And wow it’s amazing how much cheaper it is compared to a gas fill up.  So far after about a month I see no reason to think we made the wrong decision to go electric.  ', '5 days in and I’m blown away with this car, it’s looks and it’s performance. Quiet and smooth ride with the power of a beast underneath. Technology is fantastic.  Replaced my Genesis G80 gas car with this…pricewise a bargain for what I’m getting and I loved my G80. Hyundai reaches a new height here with this vehicle. \\n\\nDon’t hesitate to test drive one if you’re looking for an electric sedan. ', \"Just for background, my last car was a Honda Clarity Plug-In hybrid that had a 45 mile range on pure electric. My previous few cars were all Lincoln MKZ hybrids. Before that, a Prius hybrid. I've owned BMWs, Mercedes, Volvos, Infinities and others. I hesitated to purchase a dedicated EV because of mild range anxiety and rapid changes to technology, especially battery innovations that support more range. But I loved the feel of the Clarity on EV and hated when it ran as a hybrid. So I took the plunge.\\n\\nI've owned the 2023 Ioniq 6SEL AWD for about a week and so far I'm extremely impressed. I get about 330 miles on a full charge without trying. I expect to get less during winter months. The ride is very solid and quiet. It feels like I'm driving a cross between a touring sedan and a sports car. Neither being perfect but the combination is pretty amazing.  \\n\\nYou can watch plenty of YouTube videos to get a sense of the car's features and capabilities but I wanted to highlight some things I thought were pretty cool. I've fine tuned all of my settings. I've used the various regeneration options and can drive without using my brakes at all. The MyHyundai app, including the digital key, works great on my Android phone. Lane centering really works even at lower speeds as long as the lanes have painted lines. On the highway, the car can pretty much drive itself with lane centering, variable cruise control and lane changing assistance. It can even adjust your speed automatically based on the posted speed limits and you can bump the automatic speed control up or down by up to 5 MPH.\\n\\nI'm sure I would have enjoyed additional features available in the Limited version but I am very satisfied with the SEL.\\n\\nHonestly, this may be about the best car I've ever owned. \", 'Ioniq 6 has the power, beauty and luxury feel to it. it is indeed a no regret find of an electric car.', 'My first all-electric. Let me start out by saying that I believe Edmunds has the front legroom measurement wrong for this car. I am 6’9 & bought this because it fits me better than ANYTHING on the market (affordable.) My 5’3 daughter-in-law sits in the front with the seat all the way back and she straightens her legs out completely and they don’t even reach the floorboard.\\n\\nThe backseat has a lot of legroom too. However, with the slope of the roof the headroom is not terrific. However, I don’t plan on sitting back there…. Trunk is not big either but for me it is all about the front legroom. Ioniq 5 has much less front legroom. \\n\\nThe Sonata has great legroom in front too. Was considering the Hybrid SEL but I ended up purchasing an Ioniq 6 SE because it was only $7000 more after all the deals Hyundai gave me. The SE range of 361 iced the deal. The car will pay for itself I figure in 3-4 years. I am sure that with the type of driving that I do I will probably get 280-300 miles of range but if I had bought an SEL (rated 315) with the 20 inch wheels I probably would only get 235-255. I drive in mountains and mostly at highway speeds (75 mph). I only had this car a week but my first impression is very positive. The car rides and drives excellent and is very quiet. I have been driving in Eco mode with no problems. I like the Auto re-gen better than the 1-pedal driving mainly because I like it that way on the highway. If I drove around town only I would use 1-pedal I think. \\n\\nHappy with my purchase of an SE. There is not a new one within 300 miles of where I live so others must want the 360 mile range too. Hyundai is on to something.\\n\\n', 'I’ve had the car for about three weeks and love everything about it. It’s fast enough and it does not have any trouble keeping up on the freeway. All the driver assistance and safety features help with a very long commute in heavy Bay Area traffic. What I like best is the amount of leg room the car has in the front and rear seats. At 6’8” I can drive comfortably for hours and not feel cramped or worn out. The only downside I’ve found with this car is the rear headroom. But I’m alone 99% of the time so no issue for me. Great car. Super happy with the purchase. If you’re in the market for an EV that’s not Tesla this is definitely worth considering.

Everything works as described. It has so many great features that I\\'m watching the \"how to\" videos frequently. The fit and finish is very good and the drive is very smooth and exceptionably quiet.', \"I enjoy driving this car...It handles well and it feels like a luxury car.  I took the car on a 2000 mile trip from the midwest to the east coast and I found that the driver assist systems worked really well.  I like that the car's statistical information is in front of the driver. I also like that there are buttons as well as a touch screen that can be used to access climate and other car systems.  \"]\n"
